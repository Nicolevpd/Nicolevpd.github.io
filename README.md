# about me
## My Interests 
I am a 23-year-old mom with a beautiful 1-year-old girl. She is the reason I do everything I do. I have been traveling my whole life. So far I've been able to take my baby to Florida, Puerto Rico, Croatia, and Paris. 
## Websites I Recommend
- https://tryhackme.com/ is one of my favorite websites to study. I highly recommend taking a look, if you're interested in cyber security. They have hands-on labs and videos so you can follow along.
- https://pentesterlab.com/ is another great resource that can help you learn more.
